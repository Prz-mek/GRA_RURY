At the beggining of the file, put two points in, that when connected,
will win the level. The top left corners' coordinate is 0,0
Then put the numbers into a grid, according to the pipe they represent.

0 - empty tile
1 - obstacle
2 - LR pipe
3 - UD pipe
4 - RU pipe
5 - LU pipe
6 - LD pipe
7 - RD pipe

Why this naming convention?
At the beginning are the pipes that you must connect to win a level.
Every level should have only one starting and ending pipe, for now at least.
Type 4 and 5 are the standard pipes.
Starting from type 6 are turning pipes. They are named based on
which quarter they face towards. For example, a RU pipe could be
imagined as an L, thus spanning the entire first quarter.
Adding more types of pipes is possible.
Note: A system that scans a file like this for example, and uses that
to determine which numbers represent what would greatly increase ease
of adding new pipes.

Example level

0 0 2 1
216
004

Note: The maximum size of a level is 20x10
